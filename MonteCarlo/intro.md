# Monte Carlo Methods

## What is the Monte Carlo Simulation

Is a technique that uses **random numbers** and **probability** to solve complexe problems. It is used to understand the impact of risk in financial sectors, project management, cost and other forcasting models in ML, as well as in evaluating integrals, and complex math. 

## Examples

1. Coin Flip
2. Estimating Pi using Circle and Square
3. Monty Hall Problem
4. Buffon's Needle Problem
5. Why does the house always win?
